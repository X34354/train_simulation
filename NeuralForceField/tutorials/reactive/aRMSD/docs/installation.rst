Step 1: Install Python dependencies
---------------------

Before you install aRMSD, make sure that you have installed the following Python packages. If you are on Windows, you can download pre-compiled packages from [Christoph Gohlke's] (./http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) repository and install the wheels via pip. The following packages are needed:

- numpy 
- vtk 
- matplotlib
- cython
- uncertainties 
- openbabel 

Some of the packages have their own requirements which should be installed on-the-fly.
